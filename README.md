# Why MeowyPlayer

  It was a tranquil summer night in 2021. I was sitting in my room doing competitive programming while listening to my friend's music recommendation on YouTube. Just when I was planning to add the music to my Spotify playlist, the Spotify search engine surprisingly couldn't find the music I was looking for. In fact, popular platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music suffer from regional license restriction issues, which means there's a high chance that you won't be able to find a game OST that you like. Out of frustration, I started this ambitious project for the pure sake of listening to the music I like wherever and whenever I want. Not that I encourage pirating music, but not being able to listen to my favourite video game OST during a workout just really makes me frustrated.  
  The MeowyPlayer project started in July 2021 and has been re-written 4 times, each iteration introduces new feature and UI improvement.
