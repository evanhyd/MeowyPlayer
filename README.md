# Why MeowyPlayer

  It was a tranquil summer night in 2021. I was sitting in my room doing competitive programming while listening to my friend's music recommendation on YouTube. Just when I was planning to add the music to my Spotify playlist, the Spotify search engine surprisingly couldn't find the music I was looking for. In fact, popular platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music suffer from regional license restriction issues, which means there's a decent chance that you won't find the game OST you like. There are plenty of solutions to these: VPN, premium membership, or physically moving to the region. But being a broke student who could barely afford his tuition (I am still broke), it was a death sentence to me.    
  Out of frustration, I started this ambitious project for the pure sake of listening to music wherever and whenever I like. Not that I encourage pirating music, but not being able to listen to my favourite video game OST during a workout just really makes me frustrated. The MeowyPlayer project started in July 2021 and has been re-written 4 times as of December 2023, with each iteration introducing new features and UI improvement.
