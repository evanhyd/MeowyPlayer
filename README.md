# Why MeowyPlayer

  It was a tranquil summer night in 2021. I was sitting in my room doing competitive programming while listening to my friend's anime music recommendation on YouTube. To my surprise, Spotify's search engine failed to return the search result due to regional license restriction. This means lots of anime/game OST or platform specific music are simply not accessible to the users. To a broke student like me who could barely afford his tuition (I am still broke), it was a pain for me to hack around to collect music here and there all over the place. Out of frustration, I started this music player project.
  The MeowyPlayer project started in July 2021 and has been re-written 5 times as of August 2024, with each iteration introducing new features, better UI designs, and more maintainable code structures.
